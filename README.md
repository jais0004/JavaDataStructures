# Java Algorithm 
I am writing the Java algorithm to solve some complex problems. Each problem may have many 'optimal' solutions that differ in
runtime, space, clarity, extensibility, etc. I have provided one of the  optimal solutions

## Structure
Each folder has problems and solutions organised from easier to harder
